# IdealCleanArchitecture

Modular clean architecture implementation. If you're looking to start a new project and familiar with Redux I'd recommend The Composable Architecture (TCA). But if your team prefers/understands Clean Architecture this is a great way to enforce the boundaries between layers.

VIPER architecture style
```
View <-> Presenter
Presenter -> Router
Presenter <-> Interactor
Interactor <-> Entity
```
![VIPER](viper.png)

Passing data back typically happens between Views in VIPER, however, setting the Presenter to our delegate allows us to test more effectively.

```swift
presenterB.parentPresenter = presenterA
```

## Concepts Employed

I have employed several concepts to make this code more readable/usable.

If you'd like to read more about the approach there is [more information available here](https://medium.com/@cjnevin/modular-viper-architecture-9a7cdb7475f8).

### Swift Package Manager

Access is enforced using Swift Package Manager to ensure proper boundaries between Core and UI.

### `@Dependency` Injection

Dependencies are injected in a similar fashion to `@EnvironmentObject` using `@Dependency`, however, `@Dependency` supports protocols, so it's easier to mock.

### `@dynamicMemberLookup` and `Phantom` Types

Models enforce type restrictions by leveraging `@dynamicMemberLookup` on top of `Phantom Types`. [More information available here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/expressible-dynamic-phantom-types-513091b63f04).

### `@propertyWrapper` Styling

Styles are created using `@propertyWrapper`'s. [More information available here](https://medium.com/@cjnevin/view-styling-with-propertywrapper-92d8476e96a7).

### `@resultBuilder` `@AutoLayoutBuilder`

Constraints are created in a more Swifty way with support for nesting. [More information available here](https://betterprogramming.pub/autolayoutbuilder-294badac5015).

### `Assert` Testing

Tests are written with a little DSL I wrote over `XCTAssert`. [More information available here](https://betterprogramming.pub/assert-my-wrapper-framework-around-xctest-7d6bea2d05f9).

### Routers

I am using a slightly modified approach detailed by Cassius Pacheco which allows for composable routing. [He wrote a great article here.](https://cassiuspacheco.com/clean-simple-and-composable-routing-for-ios-apps)
